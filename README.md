## Overview

This repository contains various materials and resources used for learning Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles, including infrastructure-as-code practices, monitoring, incident response, and more.

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure-as-code configuration files used to set up various cloud resources.
- **React App**: A simple React-based front-end application demonstrating best practices in CI/CD and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: Used for infrastructure management and automation.
- **React**: Frontend application framework used for building web UIs.
- **AWS**: Cloud provider used for deploying infrastructure (via Terraform).

## Terraform Setup

This repository includes a Terraform configuration to provision AWS infrastructure. To get started with Terraform, you will need:

1. **Terraform CLI** installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. **AWS credentials** configured on your local machine. You can set them using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

### Running Terraform

To initialize the Terraform environment and apply the configurations:

```bash
cd Terraform/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Make sure you have valid AWS credentials set up.

## React App

The `my-react-app` directory contains a React project. You can install dependencies and start the development server by following these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Learn-SRE.git
   ```
2. Install and set up the necessary tools (Terraform, Node.js, etc.) as described above.
3. Navigate to the directories (`Terraform/` or `my-react-app/`) and run the respective commands.
